							<h2>About Us</h2>
							<p>
								In 2021, after a conversation regarding the convenience of
								delivery and the lack of options for alcohol and vape delivery,
								Co-Founders Chris May and Dylan Owusu sparked an idea. There was
								a need for a company that specialized solely in delivering these
								products! The concept of instant delivery for alcohol and vapes
								didnâ€™t readily exist, and they took on the challenge of changing
								that. Combining an in-store experience online with on-demand
								innovation, Pegasus Delivery was born with the
								convenience-driven consumer in mind.
